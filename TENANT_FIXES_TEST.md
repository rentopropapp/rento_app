# Tenant Interface Fixes - Test Guide

This document describes the fixes implemented for the tenant account functionality and how to test them.

## ðŸ”§ Fixes Implemented

### 1. Schedule Viewing Functionality
**Problem**: Schedule viewing button didn't create actual bookings visible to managers/brokers.

**Solution**: 
- Enhanced booking submission in `tenant/properties.html`
- Bookings now store in both database and localStorage for demo purposes
- Added validation for date/time selection
- Bookings appear in `property-manager/bookings.html` immediately
- Added comprehensive booking data including tenant details

**Test Steps**:
1. Go to `tenant/properties.html`
2. Click "Schedule Viewing" on any property
3. Select date and time, add optional notes
4. Submit the form
5. Switch to property manager account
6. Open `property-manager/bookings.html` 
7. Verify new booking appears with status "pending"

### 2. Star Rating System
**Problem**: No rating system for tenants to rate properties and affect owner ratings.

**Solution**:
- Added interactive 5-star rating system to both "My Properties" and "Scheduled Properties" sections in `tenant/dashboard.html`
- Stars are clickable and update immediately
- Ratings stored in localStorage with property ID mapping
- Owner ratings calculated and stored separately
- Visual feedback with gold stars for selected ratings

**Test Steps**:
1. Go to `tenant/dashboard.html`
2. Find the "Rate this property" sections under properties
3. Click on different stars (1-5) to rate properties
4. Verify stars turn gold and rating text updates
5. Refresh page and verify ratings persist
6. Check localStorage for `propertyRatings` and `ownerRatings` keys

### 3. Submit Request Button
**Problem**: Property search requests weren't properly submitted to broker accounts.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced the search request form in `tenant/properties.html`
- Added proper data validation and error handling
- Requests now store in both database and localStorage for brokers to see
- Added comprehensive lead data including timestamp and status
- Leads appear in `broker/leads.html` immediately

**Test Steps**:
1. Go to `tenant/properties.html`
2. Click "Request Property" button in filter bar
3. Fill out the search request form completely
4. Submit the form
5. Switch to broker account
6. Open `broker/leads.html`
7. Verify new lead appears at the top with status "new"

## ðŸ§ª Testing Scenarios

### Complete Workflow Test
1. **Tenant**: Browse properties and schedule viewing
2. **Manager**: Check bookings page and confirm the viewing
3. **Tenant**: Submit property search request
4. **Broker**: Check leads page and see the new request
5. **Tenant**: Rate properties on dashboard
6. **Verify**: Ratings persist and affect calculated owner ratings

### Data Persistence Test
1. Submit bookings and requests as tenant
2. Switch between different accounts multiple times
3. Verify data appears consistently in manager/broker views
4. Check browser localStorage for data storage
5. Refresh pages and ensure data persists

## ðŸ“Š Data Storage

For demonstration purposes, data is stored in localStorage with these keys:
- `managerBookings`: Viewing requests from tenants
- `brokerLeads`: Property search requests from tenants  
- `propertyRatings`: Individual property ratings by tenants
- `ownerRatings`: Calculated average ratings for property owners

## ðŸ”— Cross-Account Integration

The fixes ensure proper communication between user roles:
- **Tenant â†’ Manager**: Viewing bookings flow through to property manager interface
- **Tenant â†’ Broker**: Search requests appear as leads in broker interface
- **Tenant ratings**: Affect property owner ratings across the platform

## âœ… Validation Features

Added proper validation for:
- Required date/time selection for bookings
- Complete form data for search requests
- Email format validation
- Phone number requirements
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Success notifications for completed actions

## ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX Improvements

- Interactive star rating with hover effects
- Immediate visual feedback for all actions
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Form validation with helpful error messages
- Consistent styling across all interfaces
- Mobile-responsive design maintained

All fixes maintain the existing design aesthetic and are fully functional with both database connections and offline localStorage fallbacks for demonstration purposes.
