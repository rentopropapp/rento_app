# Account Switcher Functionality Test

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The account switcher functionality has been fully implemented and is ready for testing.

## 🔧 What's Been Fixed

### 1. **CSS Styles Added**
- Complete modal styling with animations
- Role-based badges (Tenant, Broker, Property Manager)
- Hover effects and current account highlighting

### 2. **Switch Account Buttons Fixed**
- ✅ All "Switch Account" buttons now have `onclick="openAccountSwitcher()"`
- ✅ Works across all pages: tenant, broker, and property manager sections

### 3. **Dynamic Loading**
- Account switcher loads automatically when needed
- Fallback system if account-switcher.js isn't initially loaded

### 4. **Mock Data for Testing**
- Same email address can have multiple role accounts
- Profile photos and complete user information
- Supports all three roles: Tenant, Broker, Property Manager

## 🧪 How to Test

1. **Open any page** with a user dropdown (tenant/dashboard.html, broker/listings.html, etc.)
2. **Click the profile avatar** in the top right
3. **Click "Switch Account"** 
4. **Modal should appear** showing all available accounts
5. **Click any account** to switch roles
6. **Page redirects** to the appropriate dashboard for that role

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### Account Switcher Modal Shows:
- **Current account** highlighted with green border
- **All available accounts** for the same email
- **Role badges** with appropriate colors:
  - 🔵 Tenant (blue)
  - 🟡 Broker (yellow) 
  - 🟢 Property Manager (green)
- **Profile photos** or initials for each account

### After Switching:
- ✅ Success notification appears
- ✅ Redirects to correct dashboard:
  - **Tenant** → `tenant/dashboard.html`
  - **Broker** → `broker/listings.html` 
  - **Property Manager** → `property-manager/dashboard.html`
- ✅ Profile avatar updates on new page
- ✅ User context completely switches

## 🔍 Test Accounts Available

All accounts use the same email but different roles:
- **John Smith (Tenant)** - ID: tenant-123
- **John Smith (Broker)** - ID: broker-456  
- **John Smith (Property Manager)** - ID: property_manager-789

## 💡 Production Notes

- In production, accounts would be fetched from the database
- Currently uses mock data when database is unavailable
- Email verification ensures users can only switch between their own accounts
- Profile photos and user data persist across role switches
